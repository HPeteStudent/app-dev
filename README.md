Moses was a Hebrew prophet, teacher, and leader who delivered his people from Egyptian slavery. He was raised by the Pharaohâ€™s daughter, but killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave. He fled to Midian, where he encountered God in a burning bush and received his mission. He returned to Egypt with his brother Aaron and confronted Pharaoh with ten plagues until he let the Israelites go.
